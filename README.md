# Green-s-Function
A program in my Modeling and Simulation class that uses Green's Function to solve an ODE and compares it to my handwritten solution. 

Instructions:
Installs of Required Software/Libraries:
You are going to need a properly running computer with at least 8GB of Ram. 
To run this program, you will need to install the following Python libraries: SciPy, NumPy and Matplotlib.

Inside the .zip file, you will find a folder labeled project3. Open this folder and then open the folder Jwhitebread_Green's.
Inside that folder you should find the Jwhitebread_Green_s.py file.

To run the program, simply copy and paste the code from my Jwhitebread_Green_s.py file into a new python project and then press run. 

There will be a graph that pops up, once you are done looking at a graph you can press the x in the top right corner to close and get the next graph.
There should be a total of 2 graphs.
